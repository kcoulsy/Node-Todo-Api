As a bit of practice, I have converted this 6+ year old js project into typescript and tidied up the codebase.

To see the state of the code beforehand see https://github.com/kcoulsy/Node-Todo-Api/tree/7af431e6fef307e4d64e3001e536f59fb13f7e6d

It wasn't terrible but definitely had lots of room to improve.
